### Credits
- [Dan Ford](https://github.com/danjford) created all the important stuff
- [Cory Simmons](https://github.com/corysimmons) created the rest
- [Puppet Scientists](http://puppetscientists.com/) created the magnifying glass logo which is available on [flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com/)

### Why?
Personally, I find it incredibly annoying having to visually parse complicated
JSON to find the selector I'd need. All those arrays nested in objects nested
in objects nested in arrays (you get the point)...

This project was inspired by the need for such a tool.
Another tool that does a similar job and came first is [JSON Selector](http://jsonselector.com).
