  :sparkles: Input JSON. Click values. Get selector. :sparkles:
</p>

### Usage
- Go to [pickyjson.com](http://pickyjson.com)
- Input **[valid JSON](http://jsonlint.com/)**
- Click a value in your JSON
- Copy and enjoy the selector
- Tell your friends

### Credits
- [Dan Ford](https://github.com/danjford) created the JSON traversal function (the important part)
- [Cory Simmons](https://github.com/corysimmons) created the rest

### Why?
Personally, I find it incredibly annoying having to visually parse complicated
JSON to find the selector I'd need. All those arrays nested in objects nested
in objects nested in arrays (you get the point)...

This project was inspired by the need for such a tool.
Another tool that does a similar job and came first is [JSON Selector](http://jsonselector.com).
